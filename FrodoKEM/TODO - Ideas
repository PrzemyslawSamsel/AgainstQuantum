1. Add tests more frequently => you write sth, you test it! (Deductive / Inductive => better?)
2. This program must be objective! Start writing classes
3. Use additional libraries instead of writing everything alone => python-mind!

4. Look at these declarations:

    (uint64_t)0x0000000000000001ULL,
    (uint64_t)0x0000000000008082ULL,
    (...)

    And you decided to zeroize uint64 if its above int range? And these c variables
    have negative values even though they're unsigned ? WTF is GOING ON??

5. WOW %lu instead of %d finally does not print these zeroes. WHAT NOW?
    have negative values even though they're unsigned ? WTF is GOING ON??
    
  
6. After implementing KEM, try to use some protocol, like TLS or sth to use this algorithm in communication effectively

7. TODO: src/sha3/keccak4x/KeccakP-1600-times4-SIMD256.c has some copyrights, check if any of the files have
them as well, and make sure to paste them at the beginning
