# Re-implementation of quantum-secure algorithm FrodoKEM in Python 3.x

This is Python implementation of FrodoKEM (Key Exchange Mechanism), as a result of my bachelor, based on [Microsoft's implementation in C](https://github.com/Microsoft/PQCrypto-LWEKE/), but using OOP (and NumPy for matrix operations). FrodoKEM is a key exchange protocol, which security is based on Learning With Errors problem - simply put it is a problem of solving a system of linear equations with probabilistic soluton, and is based on mathematical objects with regular structure called lattices. Additionally, I created a demonstration application as well in a form of "terminal-based chat" (using ncurses implementation in Python) as well as simple benchmark tool allowing the programmer to test efficiency of this implementation. FrodoKEM was implemented as a separate module, which is imported and used in Application module. In a short, Python implementation is several hundreds times slower than C, however it provides some educational value and hopefully better understanding of how this algorithm work. I did my best to at least save Microsoft's comments on what is going on in particular places of the code, as well as put mine in places which I was sure I did understand. Finally, my implementation is much shorter and gives a simple to use, abstract interface for the programmer to use it. It is also most likely as secure as Microsoft's implementation is. 


General structure
------
Similarly to Microsoft's implementation, the structure of source files is maintained. Going top-down, there is *test_kem.py* that server an interface to interact, test, benchmark FrodoKEM. Next up, there is *FrodoAPI640* file/class, which implements parameters for the lowest-security-level version of FrodoKEM (accoring to NIST proposals) - targeting bruteforce security of **AES-128**. The other versions of FrodoKEM, namely FrodoKEM-976 and FrodoKEM-1344, targeting respectively AES-192 and AES-256 are not implemented, but all the underlying methods were in fact coded, so implementing these variations is simply a matter of creating new class, adding parameters and connecting correct methods. Going down, next class to discuss is CryptoKEM. This is where all high-level mechanisms of FrodoKEM reside - *key generation*, *key encapsulation* and *key decapsulation*. It is worth to note here that FrodoKEM uses key exchange protocol based on LWEKE scheme (Learning With Errors Key Exchange), which is a bit different from Diffie-Hellman scheme. The difference is, LWEKE is not as symmetric as D-H, because both *key generation* and *key encapsulation* are probabilistic algorithms. The bottom level of files/classes structure belongs to *Frodo*, where all the abstract mathematical functions for FrodoKEM were implemented. *SHA202* implements **SHAKE** functions and **KECCAKf1600** permutations used to generate the matrix A. The *noise.py* and *util.py* files are complementary functions that have implemented some basic operations which FrodoKEM uses. General UML-like diagram shows the discussed dependencies:
